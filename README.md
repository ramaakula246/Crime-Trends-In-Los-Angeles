# 📊 Crime Data Analysis & Visualization - Los Angeles (2020–Present)

This project involves the analysis and visualization of crime data in Los Angeles from 2020 to the present. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we explored trends, patterns, and insights from the LAPD crime dataset.

## 📁 Dataset

**Name**: `Crime_Data_from_2020_to_Present.csv`  
**Source**: [L.A. City Open Data Portal](https://data.lacity.org/)  
**Description**: Contains detailed records of crimes reported in Los Angeles, including date, time, location, weapon, victim demographics, and crime classification.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the dataset.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Visualize patterns and trends (e.g., crime frequency, area-wise crime distribution, weapon usage).
- Gain insights into victim demographics.
- Highlight areas with higher crime rates.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 📊 Visualizations

- Crime Count per Year
- Crime Distribution by Area
- Monthly Crime Trend
- Victim Demographics (Age, Gender, Descent)
- Weapon Usage Trends
- Outlier Detection (Victim Age)
- Correlation Heatmap

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing Steps

- Removed duplicates
- Cleaned and standardized column names
- Handled missing values appropriately
- Converted date columns to datetime objects
- Extracted useful time-based features (year, month)

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Summary statistics (`df.describe()`)
- Correlation & covariance analysis
- Outlier detection via boxplots
- Area-wise, gender-wise, and descent-wise analysis

---

## ✅ Key Insights

- Certain areas like 77th Street and Central report the most crime.
- Crimes involving weapons like handguns are highly prevalent.
- Victims are mostly in the age range of 20–40.
- Monthly trends show fluctuation with some spikes in specific periods.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Implement machine learning for crime prediction.
- Create real-time crime heatmaps using geographic tools.
- Develop public safety dashboards and alert systems.
- Integrate external data (e.g., weather, holidays) for deeper insight.
